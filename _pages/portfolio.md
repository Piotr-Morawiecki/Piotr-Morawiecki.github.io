Modelling tailing dam failures

During the ITT Chile (12-16.12.2022) organised by SAMBA CDT and CMM (Universidad de Chile), I worked on a problem for Chilean mining company JRI. The problem concerned failure of tailing dams, which are used to store byproducts of mining operations. The goal was to develop mathematical model failures caused by the erosion of the dam from liquid tailings seeping through the base of the dam.

The model we developed incorporates the accumulation of surface water at the reservoir, with the infiltration of water through the dam. We used it to investigate effect of dam structure on its safety, and demonstrated that it can also be used to find optimal placement of drainage pipes, to minimise the risk of failure. Further study is required to understand its structural resilience for environmental factors, such as extreme rainfalls and earthquakes.
