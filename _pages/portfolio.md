Modelling tailing dam failures
---

<img align="right" src="/images/dam_collapse.png" width="400px"/>

During the ITT Chile (12-16.12.2022) organised by SAMBA CDT and CMM (Universidad de Chile), I worked on a problem for Chilean mining company JRI. The problem concerned failure of tailing dams, which are used to store byproducts of mining operations. The goal was to develop mathematical model failures caused by the erosion of the dam from liquid tailings seeping through the base of the dam.

The model we developed incorporates the accumulation of surface water at the reservoir, with the infiltration of water through the dam. We used it to investigate effect of dam structure on its safety, and demonstrated that it can also be used to find optimal placement of drainage pipes, to minimise the risk of failure. Further study is required to understand its structural resilience for environmental factors, such as extreme rainfalls and earthquakes.

Knots to Watts: generating power from water current
---

<img align="right" src="/images/WITT.png" width="400px"/>

During European Study Group with Industry organised by University of Kent on 18-22 July 2022 I worked with a team
on mathematical model of WITT gearbox. It is a device developed by WITT Energy, which generates power from water current
using a 6 degree motion energy harvesting technology. I can be attached e.g. to sea buoy, seabed or placed in a
turbulent river; the internal gearbox converts vibrations of the device into electric energy.

We developed three models. First model describes the internal mechanism of the gearbox and how external forcing in converted
into power. Second one allows to find how big forcing acts on the gearbox mechanism depending on external vibrations of the device.
The last model allows to find the external vibrations of a device for a given configuration (way it is placed in the environment, e.g.
in the sea).

Predicting effect of water extraction
---

<img align="right" src="/images/hot_spring.jpg" width="400px"/>

During the 16th Integrative Think Tank on 13-17 June 2022 I helped team working in a project for Schlumberger on
predicting the effects of deep groundwater extraction. A particular case that we focused on during this week was extraction of
groundwater from carboniferous limestone through which water from Mendip Hills travels to Bath hot springs.

We modelled a group of households extracting the hot underground water through boreholes, and investigated how would
they affect water flow and temperature when it reaches the hot water spring in Bath, and whether the flow can possibly stop
completely within the current regulations on groundwater extraction. We developed both physical and conceptual stochastic
models addressing this problem.

Approximated models of wind turbine dynamics
---
*<img align="right" src="/images/wind_turbines.jpg" width="400px"/>

During the 15th Integrative Think Tank on 31.01-4.02.2022 together with Bath Beacons group we were working on developing
mathematical models of wind turbine dynamics. Complex models currently used by engineers consist of dozens or hundreds
of parameters and numerous modular "blocks". In order to better understand the imporance of the parameters on stresses
experienced by the wind turbine and its overall performance certain approximations are used, however their limitations
are not well-understood.

During this one week workshop we set grounds for a mathematical project on deriving these approximations in a rigorous way
and quantifying their accuracy. We formulated two toy models describing stresses of a fixed turbine and dynamics of a wind turbine
attached to the sea floor using mooring lines, and quantify the effect of different simlifications.

COVID Safety in Large Events
---

<img align="right" src="/images/rugby.jpg" width="400px"/>

During a RAMP Virtual Study Group on 13.07-15.07.2021 I worked on a collaborative project with Bath Rugby on maintaining COVID
safety during large outdoor events, with the particular focus on reopening the Rugby stadium in Bath. The goal was to model 
the COVID risk in different phases of the event, and use conclusions from mathematical models to suggest mitigation strategies.

 We considered different scenarios, which were investigated independently by different subgrouops. These included finding ways
to reduce the queues length and their arrangement, optimising movement of spectators to bars and toilets during breaks and
finding optimal way for safe seat allocation (e.g. by reducing total occupancy and avoiding having many unvaccinated people
seating close to each other). We used Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the effect of different mitigation strategies.

Modelling gas temperature variation in a heat pump
---

<img align="right" src="/images/heat_pump.gif" width="400px"/>

During a Virtual Study Group in Edinbourgh on 28.06-1.07.2021 I worked on a project on optimising heat pump performance.
The main goal was to understand how to estimate the variation of a gas temperature in the Near Isothermal Stirling Heat Pump
(NISHP) developed by the Fluid Dynamics Ltd.

The project was very successful, as we proposed a simple model based on 1D heat equations, which shows how the temperature
of the gas in expander and compressor of the heat pump develops as a result of the work done by the piston and heat
exchanged with high conductive fins attached to it. The model nondimensionalisation and asymptotic methods allowed us
to obtain appoximated analytic solution. This way we indicated three main factors affecting temperature variation,
which were consistent with numerical tests we conducted as well as experimental data collected by Fluid Dynamics Ltd.

Estimating conductance using network representation
---

<img align="right" src="/images/cylinders.png" width="400px"/>

During the 165th European Study Group in April 2021 we were solving problem for Peratech company related
to modelling composite structures. We were asked to find efficient way of representing high-conductive
cylinders distributed randomly in low conductive medium in form of a network, which then can be used
to estimate the conductance of the material.

I worked on modelling the electric flow between nearby cylinders and representing it using weighted network.
Two cases were considered: one in which we have conductive medium with much lower conductivity than cylinders,
and second in which we have insulating medium, through which electron can move through direct contact between cylinders
and via quantum tunnelling process.

Modelling competition in pharmaceutic research
---

<img align="right" src="/images/pharmaceutic_research.jpg" width="400px"/>

During the 13th Integrative Think Tank in January 2021 I worked on problem from a worldwide pharmaceutic company, Roche.
The problem concerned developing methods for prioritising drug research portfolio, i.e. deciding which
drugs should be developed in each funding period. We both worked on extending existing economic portfolio
optimisation methods as well as using game theory to involve impact of competitors on expected profit.

Game theoretic approach allowed us to formulate interaction between competitors in form of a mathematical
model, which was used to: 1) develop fundamental heuristics based on analytically found Nash equilibria
in few simple scenarios, and 2) assess performance of different numerical approaches, which can be used
to find optimal strategies in more complex scenarios.

Automatic detection of anomalous crowd behaviour
---

<img align="right" src="/images/Poland_manifestation.png" width="400px"/>

During a Virtual Study Group in December 2020 I worked on developing methods for automatic anomalous crowd
behaviour for UK's Government Communications Headquarters. Given a video of the crowd (e.g. CCTV footage)
we aimed to highlight people behaving differently than others (e.g. based on their moving pattern), which
could help police or event organisers to react quickly and avoid dangerous situations.

We analysed in detail two numerically generated scenarios, one inspired by incident which took place during
a parade in Poland (see image on right) and one illustrating a group of pickpockets moving through a crowd
(see <a href="https://youtu.be/TNzJS8kyeJw">parade</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/74QaKPG9kPk">concert</a> videos).
We extracted parameters describing how people properties differ from their k-nearest neighbours, aggregated
them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used DBSCAN clustering algorithm to highlight groups of people
behaving differently. It allowed us to accurately analysed both scenarios.

Mathematical modelling of ice crystals icing in jet engines
---

<img align="right" src="/images/airplane.jpg" width="400px"/>

During 12th SAMBa Integrative Think Tank we were working on research projects for two partners,
Rolls-Royce and Novartis. The projects for Rolls-Royce involved modelling of deterioration of turbojet engines
caused by different environmental factors (such as volcanic ash, sand and dust). One of the most common risks
is caused by icing of engine components
(see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_6HxvwHsdg&ab_channel=NASAGlennResearchCenter">this YouTube video</a>)
occurring while flying through clouds at high altitudes. Understanding the impact on icing on engine deterioration is important,
when signing power-by-the-hour type contracts, where turbojet engine producers are responsible for engine maintenance 
and have therefore have higher financial risk related with potential engine damages.

During one week workshops firstly we developed complex mathematical model of icing process, capable of predicting
unstable ice particle growth more accurately than commonly used models, and run proof-of-concept numerical simulations.
Secondly we developed an optimisation framework for finding optimal flight route, which by avoiding regions
of harsh environmental conditions minimised fuel consumption, engine maintenance costs and its failure risk.

Quantifying risk under deployment uncertainty in radio spectrum management
---

<img align="right" src="/images/5G.jpg" width="400px"/>

The project was run in collaboration with Transfinite System during 162. European Study Groups with Industry
organised by University of Leeds in July 2020. This problem concerns an issue faced by regulators on whether
to grant a new operator permission to use a region of the spectrum before all the details of the new system are known,
for instance deployments of 5G infrastructure.

We improved previously used Monte Carlo methods by introducing realistic constraints on the location of deployed
radio antennas and demonstrated their effect on risk estimation in real-life scenarios. Moreover we developed
an alternative semi-analytic approach, which is much less computationally demanding and gives more precise estimates.

<img align="right" src="/images/coronavirus.jpg" width="400px"/>

 RAMP (Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic) is an initiative in UK, which is bringing modelling expertise
from a diverse range of disciplines to support the pandemic modelling community already working on Coronavirus (COVID-19).

I joined RAMP <i>Environmental and aerosol transmission</i> team, which goal is to understand the interaction of
exhaled aerosols with environmental air flows (e.g. air conditioning) so as to clarify direct and indirect transmission channels
(including via residence of virus on hard surfaces) and help develop informed strategy choices for social distancing measures.
I am part of sub-group working on quantifying the probability of infection by contact with contaminated surface depending
on the pathogen concentration, type of surface and environmental and skin conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)

Feeding Vulnerable People
---

<img align="right" src="/images/FareShare.png" width="400px"/>

During the Virtual Study Group on 29 June - 01 July we conducted a research project for FareShare - the UK's largest charity
fighting hunger and food waste. Since lockdown they observe an unprecedented demand for their services, in addition the food
surplus levels have been drastically altered. We tried to understand and forecast how demand for surplus food products is likely
to change over the coming months.

We used two approaches - a fully data-based statistical model and a dynamical model describing economic and social changes.
The dynamical model was verified and calibrated using the results obtained from the data-based approach, and so it can
be used for long-term predictions. Second team was developing mathematical models to support incentivising relationships
with food producers.

<img align="right" src="/images/smog_cars.jpg" width="400px"/>

Together with students from Water Informatics: Science &amp; Engineering CDT in University of Exeter we took part in
the <a href=https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/>2nd NERC Hackathon challange</a>
organised by the Natural Environment Research Council. Based on a range of data collected during lockdown we analysed
how working from home impacted CO2 emissions in UK. Particularly we investigated the impact of different levels of restrictions
on the change of traffic volume and the change in energy consumpiton.

The results and codes are available at: <a href="https://github.com/aricooperdavis/coronasaurus_NERCHackathonTwo_LearningFromLockdown">

<img align="right" src="/images/pollution.jpg" width="400px"/>

The project was run in 1-5 July 2020 as a part of <a href=https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/>
NERC Hackathon</a> organised by the Natural Environment Research Council. In a group of four students we built an open-source
spatio-temporal Bayesian framework in R allowing to analyse the impact of air pollution on infection rate of COVID-19.
Its flexible structure allows the users to easily model the effect of wide range of environmental, economic and demographic factors.
The framework is supplemented with a data sets for the USA and Italy.

We used the developed Bayesian framework to show that the air quality has a significant long-term correlation with the speed
of COVID-19 spread. We also at some extend compared the relative effect of different pollutants (SO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO).
We were awarded with the first place for this project.

Beyond traditional modelling in flood estimation
---

<img align="right" src="/images/flood.jpg" width="400px"/>

In academic year 2019-2020 I was working on the SAMBa Interdisciplinary Research Project focused on development
of better methodologies for studying flood estimation. It is a continuation of a project for Environmental Agency from
7th Integrative Think Tank in 2018.

My role in the team is verifying assumptions of existing statistical models and models with conceptual-physical structure
(e.g. Grid2Grid model). I compare their predictions with the physical models based on the laws of hydrodynamics.
As a result I hope to find a reason why the predictions of these models sometimes fail for small catchments
and propose modifications of existing flood estimation methods to increase the range of their applicability.

Modelling the stability of multiphase resins
---

<img align="right" src="/images/Steric_stabilization.jpg" width="400px"/>

There is a drive to improve the energy efficiency of transportation (Rail, Air, Bus, Automotive etc.)
and the use of composites can reduce weight and hence decrease the energy consumption. The composite resins
used in these applications require flame retardant additives to be added. Replacement additives are generally
solid materials (fillers) that have a variety of shapes and sizes e.g. spheres, spheroids, plates or needles.
It is normal that in low viscosity resins, there is separation of the resins and the additives,
however under various transport conditions the filler phase can pack hard.

The project was commissioned by the company Scott Bader for KTN Virtual Study Group Pilot in April 2020. The aim of the project was
to understand the mechanism by which the hard packing happens and hence determine methods of assessing new formulations for filler
separation and hard packing.

Measuring distances with multi wavelength interferometry
---

<img align="right" src="/images/Airbus.jpg" width="400px"/>

In January 2020 SAMBa organised 11th Integrative Think Tank (ITT) with projects delivered by BT and
the University of Bath Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials. I was working on photonics project
on finding an optimal method for estimating absolute distances using multi wavelength interferometry.

Firstly we quantified measurement uncertainties and based on a proposed model we found an optimal method
of wavelength selection. Further on we proposed how the measurement precision can be increased
by aggregating multiple measurements and verified its precision numerically. We hope that the project
will help developing cheaper methods for high-precise measurement. These are strongly needed
in a wide variety of industry sectors such as aerospace, marine engineering and medical technology.

Impact of slope and weather on English highways
---

<img align="right" src="/images/Highways.jpg" width="400px"/>

During the Geospatial Study Group organised in Bath on January 2020 I was working in a team on a problem presented
by Highways England. They measure average speed across approximately 17,000 sections of road in order to understand
how the strategic road network is performing continuously throughout the day. These sections of road
have been mapped against a linear network model built of line features but does not account for topography
of the terrain and weather conditions.

During the study group project we tried to:
1) understand if there is any relationships between the average speed and identifiable topographic features,
2) predict how the weather interacts with the network and particularly where aquaplaning and/or flooding could occur.

Crisp alignment and lift-off process modelling
---

<img align="right" src="/images/crisps.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="160"/>

 I worked on the optimisation of selected stages of the PepsiCo crisps production line. During 10th ITT in June 2019
team I worked in was modelling different methods of crisp alignment on two supports to find the method, which is most stable .
We tested the effect of different forces applied to the crisp and also the effect of different modes of supports' vibrations.

After the ITT I also developed a model of the crisp detachment from the conveyor belt during the frying process.
The density of the crisp submerged in oil decreases during frying. Eventually the buoyancy force overcomes the gravitation
and adhesion forces allowing the crisp to detach from the belt. As the crisp is randomly positioned on the belt,
the contact area with the belt can vary significantly, also affecting the adhesion forces. Therefore solving the problem
required using a nice combination of physical and statistical modelling.
