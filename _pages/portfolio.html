<p>During the ITT Chile (12-16.12.2022) organised by SAMBA CDT and CMM (Universidad de Chile), I worked on a problem for Chilean mining company JRI.
The problem concerned failure of tailing dams, which are used to store byproducts of mining operations. The goal was to develop mathematical model
failures caused by the erosion of the dam from liquid tailings seeping through the base of the dam.</p>

<p>The model we developed incorporates the accumulation of surface water at the reservoir, with the infiltration of water through the dam.
We used it to investigate effect of dam structure on its safety, and demonstrated that it can also be used to find optimal
placement of drainage pipes, to minimise the risk of failure. Further study is required to understand its structural resilience for environmental factors,
such as extreme rainfalls and earthquakes.</p>

<p>During European Study Group with Industry organised by University of Kent on 18-22 July 2022 I worked with a team
on mathematical model of WITT gearbox. It is a device developed by WITT Energy, which generates power from water current
using a 6 degree motion energy harvesting technology. I can be attached e.g. to sea buoy, seabed or placed in a
turbulent river; the internal gearbox converts vibrations of the device into electric energy.</p>

<p>We developed three models. First model describes the internal mechanism of the gearbox and how external forcing in converted
into power. Second one allows to find how big forcing acts on the gearbox mechanism depending on external vibrations of the device.
The last model allows to find the external vibrations of a device for a given configuration (way it is placed in the environment, e.g.
in the sea).</p>
