I am an enthusiast researcher in Applied Mathematics and an educator. Also, I have a wide experience in collaborative research projects with the industry (see "portfolio")

Industrial research
-----
I am finishing PhD in Statistical Applied Mathematics in the University of Bath in September 2023. In the PhD project, which originated from the collaboration with the Environmental Agency, I developed a mathematical framework, which allows to understand key differences between flood estimation models and their consequences (see "Flood modelling").
		
Before joining the Univerisity of Bath, I was a member of [CIAMSE](http://www.maths.com.pl/?q=english) research team in the Polish Academy of Sciences. Our work focused on research projects in the field of	industrial mathematics for companies representing various branches of the industry. I continued this work by attending multiple study groups and think tanks over the last few years.

Education and outreach
-----
Currently, I am a Physics teacher in the IB Diploma Programme in [2SLO high school](https://ib.2slo.pl/) in Warsaw. I actively promote science among youth on various educational programmes and events. These include:
* running tutorials and lectures for "Matematyka dla Ciekawych Swiata" (in English "*Mathematics for those curious about the world*"), a semester-long programme for ambitious secondary school students organised by Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling at the University of Warsaw.
* supervising research projects for school students (*e.g.* ArctowSky team which won Polish edition of [CanSAT competition](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat) 2018/19 organised by the European Space Agency).
* in the past running lectures and demonstrations in many educational events (RI Masterclasses, Warsaw Science Festival, Warsaw Science Picnic etc.)
